# Discover System

## Overview

Creates and advances discovery epochs through capture, extraction, sufficiency checks, challenged assumptions, outcomes, journeys, and slices.


## Conventions

- Bare paths such as `templates/slice.yaml` resolve from this skill's installed directory.
- Shared LENS references live at `../bmad-lens-setup/assets/lens/`.
- Project artifacts use `_bmad-output/lens/` unless module config overrides the output folder.
- IDs are identity. Paths are addresses and must not be used as identity.
- Archive records history, Landscape records current truth, and Graph records derived projections.
- AI hypotheses are not facts. Mark status, confidence, provenance, and open questions explicitly.
- No growth without pressure: never promote a slice into a capability, domain, program, or system without repeated evidence and human review.

## On Activation

1. Load available config from `{project-root}/_bmad/config.yaml` and `{project-root}/_bmad/config.user.yaml`, including the `lens` section when present.
2. If config is missing, continue with defaults and mention that `bmad-lens-setup` can register the module.
3. Read `../bmad-lens-setup/assets/lens/references/lens-module-guide.md` for the LENS model.
4. Read `../bmad-lens-setup/assets/lens/references/skill-contracts.md` and follow the section for this skill.
5. Prefer existing project artifacts in `_bmad-output/lens/` over recreating them.
6. Do not overwrite unrelated user changes. When updating ledgers, supersede or append unless the user asks for a direct replacement.

## Procedure

1. Create or resume a discovery epoch.
2. Ask focused questions and capture responses as raw material.
3. Extract candidate concepts with status and confidence.
4. Challenge assumptions and record open questions.
5. Build a candidate slice overview from the strongest journey paths. Keep `slice` as the source-truth term, but describe candidates as thin work options when that is clearer for humans.
6. Name the selected first slice, adjacent or deferred slices, and the reason each is first, adjacent, or deferred.
7. Produce a discovery next-step map using `../bmad-lens-setup/assets/lens/templates/discovery-next-steps.md`: current gate, review order, candidate slice overview, and action queue.
8. Recommend next LENS and BMAD skills. Do not recommend BMAD PRD, UX, architecture, epics, or stories until the action queue shows that the context gate is ready or explicitly accepted by the user.

## Required Output Discipline

- Write artifacts only under the configured LENS output folders unless the user gives another path.
- Preserve source references and confidence on every major entity.
- For bottom-up slices, do not require system, domain, service, capability, program, initiative, or roadmap fields.
- For top-down work, do not recommend BMAD PRD creation until `bmad-lens-context-check` says PRD readiness is ready or explicitly accepted by the user.
- When a BMAD workflow is the correct next step, recommend the BMAD skill by name and explain what LENS packet or evidence should feed it.

## Produces

discovery epoch, discovery notes, candidate slice overview, and discovery next-step map.
